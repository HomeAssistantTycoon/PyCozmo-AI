# Cube 2 AI Model
This AI model should with some level of accuracy be able to identify the cube 2 that comes with Cozmo. I successfully ran it on a Windows 10 with a very crappy GPU, so you shouldn't have much trouble. The best.pt files is trained off of the YOLOv8 nano image recognition model. I've provided my images dataset for anyone who wants to improve on it.
